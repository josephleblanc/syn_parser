# Historical Completed Todo Lists

This will be a useful reference when I want to put more effort into writing up
this project. Additionally, it will help to track how much progress was made on
what days, and give me a better idea of what kinds of goal-tracking works best
for my work flow.

I should put more before the next sections, but I am starting this document a little late.

## Finishing up Item Coverage + first pass at Testing

2025-03-09

```markdown
## Step 1: Expand Item Coverage ✓

Your code already handles several important Rust items (functions, structs, enums, implementations, traits), and now also includes:

1. **Module Structure**: ✓
   - Added `ModuleNode` to represent module hierarchy
   - Tracking imports/exports between modules to establish cross-module relationships
   - Storing module-level documentation

2. **Use Declarations & Extern Crates**: ✓
   - Created `ImportNode` to represent both use statements and extern crates
   - Established `UseRelation` edges between items and their imports
   - Now tracking which external dependencies are being used

3. **Type Aliases, Unions, and Trait Aliases**: ✓
   - Extend `TypeDefNode` enum to include these additional type definitions
   - These provide important aliasing and type relationship information

4. **Constants and Statics**: ✓
   - Add `ValueNode` to represent constants and static variables
   - Track type information and initialization expressions
   - Important for understanding program constants and global state

5. **Macros and Macro Rules**: ✓
   - Create `MacroNode` to capture macro definitions
   - Record macro invocations as `MacroUseRelation`
   - This is critical for understanding Rust's meta-programming features
```
