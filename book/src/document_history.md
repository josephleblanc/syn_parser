# Historical Completed Todo Lists

This will be a useful reference when I want to put more effort into writing up
this project. Additionally, it will help to track how much progress was made on
what days, and give me a better idea of what kinds of goal-tracking works best
for my work flow.

I should put more before the next sections, but I am starting this document a little late.

## Finishing up Item Coverage + first pass at Testing

2025-03-09

```markdown
## Step 1: Expand Item Coverage ✓

Your code already handles several important Rust items (functions, structs, enums, implementations, traits), and now also includes:

1. **Module Structure**: ✓
   - Added `ModuleNode` to represent module hierarchy
   - Tracking imports/exports between modules to establish cross-module relationships
   - Storing module-level documentation

2. **Use Declarations & Extern Crates**: ✓
   - Created `ImportNode` to represent both use statements and extern crates
   - Established `UseRelation` edges between items and their imports
   - Now tracking which external dependencies are being used

3. **Type Aliases, Unions, and Trait Aliases**: ✓
   - Extend `TypeDefNode` enum to include these additional type definitions
   - These provide important aliasing and type relationship information

4. **Constants and Statics**: ✓
   - Add `ValueNode` to represent constants and static variables
   - Track type information and initialization expressions
   - Important for understanding program constants and global state

5. **Macros and Macro Rules**: ✓
   - Create `MacroNode` to capture macro definitions
   - Record macro invocations as `MacroUseRelation`
   - This is critical for understanding Rust's meta-programming features
```

## Make project more modular

## Complete second pass at tests, now modular

2025-03-10 - (unfinished)

## Make visitor more modular

I've been running into problems regarding the size of the visitor.rs file lately. It is big enough that it fills the context window of aider LLMs more often than not (almost always causing problems around ~30k tokens).

This almost certainly means it is way too big, and avoiding a core
functionality because it is unwieldy seems like a bad thing for both human
documentation and ai integration.

┃               Current State of the Visitor Module Refactor               ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

The visitor module refactoring is approximately 70% complete. We've
successfully implemented the core trait hierarchy with CodeProcessor as the
foundation and established blanket implementations for all operation traits.

                              Progress So Far                               

 1 Core trait hierarchy established with proper bounds and constraints
 2 Blanket implementations created for all operation traits
 3 TypeProcessor and GenericsProcessor specialized traits implemented
 4 Proper re-exports of traits and types added
 5 Documentation updated with the trait-based architecture
 6 Generics processing refactored to follow the trait pattern

                              Remaining Steps                               

  1 Complete the domain-specific visitor traits (FunctionVisitor,
    StructVisitor, etc.) following the established pattern
  2 Refactor direct state access in CodeVisitor to use trait methods where  
    appropriate
  3 Implement a MacroProcessor trait for specialized macro handling
  4 Remove duplicate code between GenericProcessor and standalone utility
    functions
  5 Update the CodeVisitor implementation to properly delegate to the
    domain-specific traits
  6 Add tests specifically for the trait implementations to ensure proper
    delegation
  7 Standardize error handling across visitor implementations
  8 Fix any type/relation inconsistencies in the visitor state
    implementation
  9 Validate the complete visitor pipeline with integration tests
 10 Update remaining documentation and inline code comments to match the new
    architecture

The next highest priority task is to continue implementing the
domain-specific visitor traits (functions, structs, etc.) to follow the same
consistent pattern as TypeProcessor and GenericsProcessor.
