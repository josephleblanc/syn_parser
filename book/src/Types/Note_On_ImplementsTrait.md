Why does RelationKind::ImplementsTrait(TraitId) need to wrap a TraitId when none of the other RelationKind variants wrap their targets?

Let's break this down systematically. You're raising excellent points about the system's evolution - let's think through these architectural concerns together:

### 1. **ImplementsTrait and ID Validity**
Your observation about validation is valid, but there's nuance in the TraitId usage:

```rust
RelationKind::ImplementsTrait(TraitId)
```

**Why keep TraitId:**
- **Semantic Meaning**: The ID isn't just a validator - it's part of the relation's identity. Two different trait implementations would be indistinguishable without this.
- **Graph Consistency**: When converting to UUIDs, we'll need to maintain referential integrity between relations and their endpoints.
- **Query Efficiency**: Directly embedding the ID enables O(1) lookups of "what traits does this type implement" without graph traversal.

**Validation Layer vs Data Model:**
- The validation ensures the TraitId exists in the system
- The data model needs to store the specific trait being referenced
- Even with UUID conversion, we'd still need this reference - it would just be a UUID instead of usize
