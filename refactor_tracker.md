# Code Graph Parser Refactor Progress

## Current Step: Extract Type Processing Logic

### Changes Made Since Last Step:
✔️ Created basic state.rs with VisitorState core
⚠️ Partial type processing moved - needs completion

### Immediate Next Actions:
1. Move type resolution from visitor/mod.rs to type_processing.rs
2. Set up TypeProcessor trait boundary
3. Update imports in visitor/mod.rs to use new type module

### Safety Checks:
✅ Ensure `analyze_code` remains publicly accessible  
✅ Verify existing tests still pass after move  
✅ Maintain all existing imports/exports
