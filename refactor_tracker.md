# Code Graph Parser Refactor Progress

## Current Step: Validate Type Processing Extraction

### Changes Made Since Last Step:
✔️ Moved all type resolution to type_processing.rs
✔️ Established TypeProcessor trait boundary
✔️ Updated imports throughout visitor implementation

### Immediate Next Actions:
1. Verify trait bounds in generic_params.rs
2. Update test imports and fix any visibility issues
3. Benchmark performance before/after change

### Safety Checks:
✅ All type-related tests passing
✅ No compilation errors in visitor pattern
✅ Serialization still captures type relationships
