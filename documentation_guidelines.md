Documentation should:

1. Capture each component's raison d'Ãªtre
2. Document important types and their relationships
3. Surface dependencies between modules
4. Identify potential areas of duplication
5. Create natural cross-references between components
6. Details specific pattern adherence with concrete examples                                         
7. Highlights intentional deviations from common patterns                                            
8. Maintains existing integration points while expanding technical context                           
9. References actual field names and type relationships from code                                    
10. Explains design choices around storage strategies and type organization  

From looking at your codebase, we should particularly focus on:
- The visitor pattern implementation in `parser/visitor/`
- Type system handling in `types.rs` and `type_processing.rs`
- Graph structure definitions in `graph.rs`
- State management in `state.rs`
- Attribute/docstring processing in the `utils/` directory

Would you like me to start applying this template with the first file (`src/lib.rs`), then proceed through the dependency chain? We can iterate on the template as we go if we find it needs adjustment.
