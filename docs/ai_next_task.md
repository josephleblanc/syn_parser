# AI Next Task

1. **Investigate missing direct implementation for ModuleStruct**:
   - Added debug prints for method names in impl blocks
   - Verify why direct impl isn't being detected

2. **Handle directory-based module imports**:
   - Update parser to handle module declarations from external files
   - Ensure test_dir/example_file.rs is processed

3. **Add multi-file analysis support**:
   - Modify analyze_code to recursively process module files
   - Handle file system paths for submodules

4. **Update test expectations**:
   - Adjust counts after implementing full module resolution
   - Verify all expected implementations are found

5. **Final validation**:
   - Run `cargo test` with full module support
   - Confirm all tests pass with accurate code graph
