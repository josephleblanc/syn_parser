┃                      Making Tests More Modular for the Code Graph Project                       ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛


Based on the code you've shared, I can see you have a comprehensive parser that
builds a code graph from Rust source files. Your current testing approach in
tests/parser_tests.rs is a single large test function that checks many aspects
of the parser. Let's make this more modular and maintainable.

                                     Current Testing Structure                                     

Your current test:

 • Uses a single sample file (tests/data/sample.rs)
 • Has one large test function that checks many different aspects
 • Mixes different concerns (parsing, serialization, entity counts, specific entity details)
 • Makes assertions about many different types of nodes in the same test

                                Proposed Modular Testing Structure                                 

Here's how I recommend organizing your tests:

                                     1. Split Tests by Concern                                     

Create separate test modules for different aspects of your code:

 tests/
 ├── parser/
 │   ├── mod.rs
 │   ├── basic_parsing.rs      # Basic parsing functionality
 │   ├── functions_tests.rs    # Function parsing tests
 │   ├── structs_tests.rs      # Struct parsing tests
 │   ├── enums_tests.rs        # Enum parsing tests
 │   ├── traits_tests.rs       # Trait parsing tests
 │   ├── impls_tests.rs        # Implementation tests
 │   ├── modules_tests.rs      # Module parsing tests
 │   ├── macros_tests.rs       # Macro parsing tests
 │   └── visibility_tests.rs   # Visibility handling tests
 ├── serialization/
 │   ├── mod.rs
 │   ├── ron_tests.rs          # RON serialization tests
 │   └── json_tests.rs         # JSON serialization tests (if implemented)
 └── integration/
     ├── mod.rs
     └── full_graph_tests.rs   # End-to-end tests

                                      2. Create Test Fixtures                                      

Instead of relying on a single large sample file, create smaller, focused test fixtures:

 tests/fixtures/
 ├── functions.rs        # Sample with various function types
 ├── structs.rs          # Sample with various struct types
 ├── enums.rs            # Sample with various enum types
 ├── traits.rs           # Sample with trait definitions and implementations
 ├── modules.rs          # Sample with module structure
 ├── visibility.rs       # Sample with different visibility modifiers
 └── macros.rs           # Sample with macro definitions
