# AI Project Notes

## Architecture Overview

The parser uses a two-layer visitor pattern:
1. **CodeVisitor** - AST traversal and delegation
2. **VisitorState** - State management and graph construction

Key components:
- Processor traits define domain operations
- State maintains code graph and type system
- Domain-specific visitors handle language constructs

## Current Challenge Areas

1. **Trait Implementation Tracking**
   - Need to match impl blocks with their corresponding traits
   - Generic type parameters complicate matching
   - Visibility modifiers affect registration locations

2. **Module System Complexities**
   - Nested module hierarchy tracking
   - Item visibility and accessibility
   - Delayed relationship resolution

3. **Type System Edge Cases**
   - Lifetime parameter tracking
   - Associated types in traits
   - Complex generic bounds

## Debugging Strategy

1. Focus on failing test cases as specification
2. Validate visitor state after each processing step
3. Check intermediate graph representations
4. Verify trait/impl matching logic
5. Audit type ID generation and deduplication

## Potential Improvements

- Add detailed logging for visitor operations
- Create visualization of code graph structure
- Implement incremental parsing capabilities
- Add more validation steps during graph construction
