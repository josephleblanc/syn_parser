I'll suggest a structured template we can use in `project_description.md` that captures each component's role. Based on the codebase structure, here's a proposed format:

```markdown
# Project Structure Documentation

## Module: [Module Name]
**Path:** `src/path/to/module.rs`  
**Purpose:** [1-2 sentence description of main responsibility]

### Key Data Structures
- `StructName`: 
  - Purpose: [What it represents]
  - Key Fields:
    - `field_name`: [Description]
    - `field_name`: [Description]

### Key Traits/Interfaces
- `TraitName`:
  - Responsibility: [What behavior it defines]
  - Important Implementors: [List of implementing structs]

### Core Functions/Methods
- `fn_name()`:
  - Inputs: [Parameters]
  - Outputs: [Return value]
  - Functionality: [What it accomplishes]

### Integration Points
- Interacts with: [Other modules/components]
- Used by: [Consumers of this module]
- Depends on: [Dependencies]

---

```

For utility files/modules, we could use a simplified version:

```markdown
## Utility: [Utility Name]
**Path:** `src/path/to/utility.rs`  
**Purpose:** [Specialized functionality]

### Key Functions
- `helper_fn()`:
  - Purpose: [Specific use case]
  - Typical Callers: [Which components use this]

### Shared Types
- `CustomType`: [Description of type alias/enum]

---
```

This approach would help us:
1. Capture each component's raison d'Ãªtre
2. Document important types and their relationships
3. Surface dependencies between modules
4. Identify potential areas of duplication
5. Create natural cross-references between components

From looking at your codebase, we should particularly focus on:
- The visitor pattern implementation in `parser/visitor/`
- Type system handling in `types.rs` and `type_processing.rs`
- Graph structure definitions in `graph.rs`
- State management in `state.rs`
- Attribute/docstring processing in the `utils/` directory

Would you like me to start applying this template with the first file (`src/lib.rs`), then proceed through the dependency chain? We can iterate on the template as we go if we find it needs adjustment.
